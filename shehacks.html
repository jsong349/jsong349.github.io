                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <br>
                <p>How can we encourage Canadian youth to become financially literate and encourage sustainable habits?</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <br>
                <p>A mobile app that allows the user to track steps and environmentally friendly transportation habits in order
                    to calculate the money saved, carbon dioxide reduced, and calories burned to foster positive habits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>User Research </h3>
                <br>
                <p>We wanted to take a deeper look into the target demographic of Canadian youth. Why are youth often apathetic
                    towards their spending habits? What incentivizes youth to learn, and continue learning? What services are
                    currently offered and why are they not effective?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Through interviewing peers and hackathon attendees, we discovered a few main takeaways:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Budgeting apps are often ineffective</strong> ‚Äì with little incentive, user attention is quickly lost;
                                oftentimes apps with a social or interactive aspect tend to succeed</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>It‚Äôs not so much about apathy as it is about lack of resources</strong> ‚Äì users felt as if there wasn‚Äôt
                                enough material that was easily digestible and simple to implement into their daily lives</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>People are unaware of their ecological footprint</strong> ‚Äì users often don‚Äôt know which lifestyle changes
                                negatively impact the environment, and ways in which they can improve upon this</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>After conducting user interviews, my team wanted to create a simple app to track the sustainability of user habits. With
                    transportation being one of the biggest contributing factors to the rise of carbon dioxide levels, we decided to integrate
                    the idea of using alternative forms of transportation to foster healthier lifestyles and decrease ecological footprint.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="img-mocks">
                <div>
                    <img class="brainstorm" id="brainstorm1" src="brainstorm1.png" alt="brainstorm">

                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>We also wanted to integrate a social aspect to retain users and generate more excitement surrounding the app. As a result of our brainstorming,
                    we created a function whereby users could form groups and compete on a leaderboard to create an interactive environment.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h3>Design & Prototyping</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In order to design a user-friendly app that would continuously attract more users, I prototyped our idea from start to finish on Adobe XD.
                    This helped capture the user-flow and allowed us to test the usability of the app before completing any back-end work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Let‚Äôs take a look through some of the key features we deployed:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="features">
            <div  class="mock-format"><img class="screen" src="mock3.png"></div>
            <div class = "feature-desc">
                <br>
                <h2>TRACKING</h2>
                <p>Presenting the collected data in an easily digestible format</p>
                <br>
                <p>The main interface focuses on quickly communicating significant information. As the lead designer, I decided to use
                    a friendly tone when communicating with the user. Each data figure is also accompanied by a simple icon, allowing
                    the user to identify their measurable outcomes almost instantly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Rather than guilt and pressure, we utilized positive reinforcement to encourage the user to make a positive impact on
                    their daily transportation habits.
                </p>
            </div>
            </div>
                <div class="features">
                    <div class="mock-format"><img class="screen" src="mock4.png"></div>
                    <div class = "feature-desc">
                        <br>
                        <h2>GROUPS</h2>
                        <p>Throwing some friendly competition into the mix!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In order to foster a sense of community and encourage the long-term use of our app, we implemented a groups feature.
                            Upon surveying many of the companies who attended SheHacks, we were pleased to discover that <i>Step By Step</i> appealed
                            to organizations as a unique approach to stimulating company culture.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            While sustainability isn‚Äôt a contest, a little push from friends, family, and coworkers certainly can‚Äôt hurt!

                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Given the 24-hour time restriction, my team was proud to present a responsive app prototype built using REACT.js, HTML, and CSS.
                        It was my first time using any of these languages, so there was certainly a learning curve. However, with a lack of sleep
                        and an overwhelming number of snacks, we were able to deploy a functioning prototype and amaze a couple of judges!
                        Needless to say, I couldn‚Äôt have done it without my amazing team.
