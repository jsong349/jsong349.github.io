                    By integrating the functionality of machine learning driven optical character recognition, we
                    automatically identify the payee, account number, and amount due. You can simply take a photo of
                    your bill within the app, or forward your bill via email for processing - QuickBill handles the
                    rest!</p>

                <br>
                <p>Develop a solution to a problem that Scotiabank customers experience that Scotiabank hasn‚Äôt built a
                    solution for already.

                <br>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <br>
                <p>A new feature on the Scotiabank banking app that allows the user to pay bills with a few swipes. By setting
                    up email forwarding or taking a quick picture of your bill, all bill payments are now centralized on the
                    banking app.</p>

                <h3>User Research </h3>
                <br>
                <p>We wanted to take a deeper look into our target demographics of seniors, newcomers, and people on-the-go.
                    Why are bill payments so frustrating? What services are currently offered and why are they not effective?
                    Why are people constantly late on payments?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Through interviewing parents and grandparents, we discovered a few main takeaways:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>The bill payments process is a hassle</strong> ‚Äì from receiving multiple bills in
                                your mailbox or email, to typing out the numbers online, to finally paying a bill, then
                                repeating that process again for every payment, the process is time consuming</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>People are looking for more digital banking solutions</strong> ‚Äì the times of
                                waiting in a long line at a banking branch are over, people are looking for quicker
                                solutions from the comfort of their own home</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Dealing with payments is messy</strong> ‚Äì users felt it was difficult to keep
                                track of payments and their deadlines</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>With an increasing number of Scotia customers utilizing digital banking, my team wanted to create
                        a new feature to tackle the issue of bill payments with a simple app feature.
                        We understood that payments are typically received digitally, through monthly emails or
                        physically, to the user's mailbox. We then set
                        out to create a solution that addressed both sides of bill payment.
                    </p> <br>
                    <img class="ideation" src="ideationscotia.jpg" alt="brainstorm"><br>
                    <p>As a result of our brainstorming, we decided to create a direct forwarding feature to address the
                        payments received digitally and an image recognition feature to address the payments received
                        physically.
                    </p>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Design & Prototyping</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In order to design a user-friendly feature that would attract more users and increase user engagement
                    in our existing users, I prototyped our idea from start to finish on Figma. This allowed us to
                    evaluate technical feasibility and user specification.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Let‚Äôs take a look through some of the key features we deployed:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="features">
                <div  class="mock-format"><img class="screenscotia" src="mock2scotia.png"></div>
                <div class = "feature-desc">
                    <br>
                    <h2>DIRECT FORWARDING</h2>
                    <p>Presenting all bills on a centralized page</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With this new feature, users can set up forwarding from their personal email inbox directly to
                        their Scotia app. Worried about privacy? QuickBill allows users to approve senders before bill
                        payments can proceed. It's that simple! Now all bill payments will be displayed right on the Scotia app.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Users can then pay bills individually, or all at once, mitigating the issue of hassle and
                        disorganization of traditional bill payment.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class = "feature-desc">
                    <br>
                    <h2>IMAGE RECOGNITION</h2>
                    <p>Allowing in-app automatic payments</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Instead of adding a new payee, users can click onto the "Capture bills by image recognition"
                        feature, and take a photo of their paper bill right on the app. The information will then
                        automatically populate, and the user can pay on the spot!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Rather than wasting time typing out every bill separately, this new feature now allows user to
                        save time with greater accuracy.

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <br>
                <p>My team was proud to present a high-fidelity app prototype built with Typescript, Node, Express,
                    Google Cloud Vision, MongoDB, and Flutter.
                    It was my first time learning Flutter, but with the help of my team we were able to deliver a fully
                    functional demonstration. With the constraints of COVID-19, this virtual hackathon required a
                    3-minute pitch to win the judges over.
                    Leveraging Canva, Vidyard, and iMovie, I was able to put together an engaging pitch to bring our
                    vision to life.
